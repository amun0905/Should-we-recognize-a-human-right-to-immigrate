This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's undergraduate essay in Political Philosophy, answering the question "Should we recognize a human right to immigrate?". 

The essay critically examines whether this right should be recognised, using three argumentative strategies outlined by David Miller:
- **Instrumental Strategy** - Immigration as instrumental to securing other fundamental rights (e.g., adequate standard of living).  
- **Cantilever Strategy** - Immigration rights as an extension of domestic freedom of movement.  
- **Direct Strategy** - Immigration grounded in basic human interests beyond existing rights.  

The essay concludes that the instrumental strategy provides the strongest case for more open borders but does not justify an unrestricted right to immigration.

Feedback: This is a good essay. Shows very good knowledge and understanding of the Miller-Oberman debate. Nice presentation of that debate. Writing is clear throughout. Remains focused on the question. Ideas are nicely organised. Would have benefited from using the extra space available to develop the argument beyond Miller-Oberman, and to show knowledge of wider issues and literature. Overall, a good effort.
